Template Function for Python
============================

TemplateFunction is a flexible python class that acts as a middle-ground between
FP and OOP, allowing you to create classes that act as functions. It blends the 
simplicity of functions with the structural integrity of heirarchical systems of 
inheritance.

To illustrate the effectiveness of using TemplateFunctions, suppose you needed to
create 10 functions, each with very similar code but a minor change in functionality.
Instead of writing 10 copies of the same code, you would only write the base function 
once in a TemplateFunction, then create child TemplateFunctions that provide the 
necessary specific functionality.

TemplateFunctions also supply many other features, such as dynamic decoration,
dynamic composition, default and variable parameters, abstract functions, and
lazy evaluation.

For more information and examples, see help(TemplateFunction).
